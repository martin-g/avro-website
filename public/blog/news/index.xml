        &lt;p&gt;The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Avro
has invited David Mollitor to become a committer and we are pleased
to announce that he has accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2017, David has raised and fixed many issues in the
Java SDK.  Recently he&amp;rsquo;s been finding and providing fixes for subtle
performance issues.  His work is always high-quality and he is
reactive and pleasant to talk with on code reviews and JIRA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
submission process. This should enable better productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s great to have you as part of the team, David!&lt;/p&gt;
